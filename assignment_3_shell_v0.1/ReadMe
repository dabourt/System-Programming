Now you can create the static or dynamic library by using the make file and also can to execute the program by static or dynamic linking.

to build the project with --dynamic-- linking use this command:
	make
or 	make dy

to build the project with --static-- linking use this command:
	make st

If you want to create the dynamic library use this command:
	make create_dynamic_lib
	
	
Note: if you create the dynamic library you must pass his directory to LD_LIBRARY_PATH so use this command
	bash run
